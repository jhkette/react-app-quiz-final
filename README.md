A simple quiz app that uses and api, AWS lambda functions and react. I've only added relatively small amount of CSS as I was more concerned with programming the functionality of a quiz

## Installation
Run npm/yarn install to install all depenedencies. To run locally run yarn start:lambda and then yarn start on another terminal windown.If you are using a different quiz api (if one exists?) change the url on src/lambda/getdata.js file.

## Deploy

I've deployed this application on netlify. I simply connected it to a git repository. The build command is yarn build.
